# Course Overview

**&lt;center&gt; This review doesn't replace reading the syllabus! &lt;/center&gt;**

---

## Course Modality

- This is an in-person course: that means that, unlike asynchronous online/WEB courses, we will meet during scheduled class meeting times in Lokey 176. 

- There is no Zoom link to attend the classes synchronously.

- The lectures will be recorded using Panopto and the links will be posted on CANVAS. 
  
- If you need accommodation related to a medical or other disability, you can set those up through AEC (https://aec.uoregon.edu).

---

## Course Description

EDLD 654: Machine Learning for Educational Data Science

- is the fourth in a sequence of courses on educational data science (EDS) specialization, 

- is taught using free and open-source statistical programming languages,

- aims to teach how to apply several predictive modeling approaches to educational and social science datasets, 

- emphasizes supervised learning methods that have emerged over the last several decades.

The primary goal of the methods covered in this course is to create models capable of making accurate predictions, which generally implies less emphasis on statistical inference.


See the syllabus for a detailed list of learning outcomes.

---
## Prerequisites

- Successful completion of the first three courses in EDS specialization (EDLD 651, EDLD 652, and EDLD  653) is required to enroll in this course. 

- Successful completion of an introductory and intermediate course in statistics (e.g., EDUC 614, EDUC 642) would be helpful and complimentary.

- If you have never taken a course on linear algebra and calculus, there are some notes to read on the website (Week 0). It may be useful to review them.

---
## Office hours

- Online office hours: 
  
  - Wednesday, 4 pm – 5 pm (Zoom)

# Introduction to Toy Datasets  

---

## CommonLit Readability Competition

- A Kaggle competition that took place between May 2021 - Aug 2021.

- [Competition website](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/commonlitreadabilityprize/overview)

- There is a total of 2834 observations. 
  
  - The unit of analysis is a text. So, each observation represents a plain text. 
  
  - The most significant variables are the `excerpt` and `target` columns. 
  
  - The excerpt column includes plain text data.
  
  - The target column includes a corresponding measure of readability for each excerpt.

A snapshot:

&lt;table class=" lightable-paper lightable-striped lightable-hover table" style='font-family: "Arial Narrow", arial, helvetica, sans-serif; width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; font-size: 14px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;'&gt;
 &lt;thead&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt;   &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; excerpt &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; target &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 1706 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 50em; "&gt; The commutator is peculiar, consisting of only three segments of a copper ring, while in the simplest of other continuous current generators several times that number exist, and frequently 120! segments are to be found. These three segments are made so as to be removable in a moment for cleaning or replacement. They are mounted upon a metal support, and are surrounded on all sides by a free air space, and cannot, therefore, lose their insulated condition. This feature of air insulation is peculiar to this system, and is very important as a factor in the durability of the commutator. Besides this, the commutator is sustained by supports carried in flanges upon the shaft, which flanges, as an additional safeguard, are coated all over with hard rubber, one of the finest known insulators. It may be stated, without fear of contradiction, that no other commutator made is so thoroughly insulated and protected. The three commutator segments virtually constitute a single copper ring, mounted in free air, and cut into three equal pieces by slots across its face. &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; -3.676268 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; 2830 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 50em; "&gt; When you think of dinosaurs and where they lived, what do you picture? Do you see hot, steamy swamps, thick jungles, or sunny plains? Dinosaurs lived in those places, yes. But did you know that some dinosaurs lived in the cold and the darkness near the North and South Poles?
This surprised scientists, too. Paleontologists used to believe that dinosaurs lived only in the warmest parts of the world. They thought that dinosaurs could only have lived in places where turtles, crocodiles, and snakes live today. Later, these dinosaur scientists began finding bones in surprising places.
One of those surprising fossil beds is a place called Dinosaur Cove, Australia. One hundred million years ago, Australia was connected to Antarctica. Both continents were located near the South Pole. Today, paleontologists dig dinosaur fossils out of the ground. They think about what those ancient bones must mean. &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 1.711390 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

- *"the target value is the result of a Bradley-Terry analysis of more than 111,000 pairwise comparisons between excerpts. Teachers spanning grades 3-12 served as the raters for these comparisons."* 

- A lower target value indicates a more challenging text to read. 

- The highest target score is equivalent to the 3rd-grade level

- The lowest target score is equivalent to the 12th-grade level. 

---

- The purpose is to develop a model that predicts a readability score for a given text.

- A successful model may serve for important purposes in education such as identifying an appropriate reading level for a given text.

&lt;table class=" lightable-paper lightable-striped lightable-hover table" style='font-family: "Arial Narrow", arial, helvetica, sans-serif; width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; font-size: 14px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;'&gt;

  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; excerpt &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; score &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;width: 50em; "&gt; In the freezing ocean waters of Antarctica, the planet's largest seals make their home in a frozen world. These giants are southern elephant seals, and they can grow as long as the length of a car and weigh as much as two cars combined. The name “elephant seal” comes from both the males' enormous size and from their giant trunk-like nose, called a proboscis. Females do not have a proboscis and they are much smaller. A thick layer of blubber keeps southern elephant seals warm in their icy habitat. The seals are clumsy on land, but in water they’re graceful swimmers and incredible divers. They can easily dive 1,000 to 4,000 feet to hunt for squid, octopus, and various kinds of fish. Elephant seals are able to stay underwater for 20 minutes or more. The longest underwater session researchers observed is an amazing two hours! When they return to the surface to breathe, it’s only for a few minutes. Then they dive again. &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; ? &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


- Other potential use cases of skills learned in this class relevant to education:

  - automated essay scoring: essay ---&gt; rating
  
  - sentiment analysis: feedback ---&gt; positive, negative, neutral
  
  - automated writing evaluation: argumentative writing ---&gt; effective, adequate, ineffective
  
  - automated item generation: a reading passage ---&gt; questions and answers

---

## NIJ's Recidivism Challenge

- The Recidivism dataset comes from The National Institute of Justice’s (NIJ) Recidivism Forecasting Challenge. 

  https://nij.ojp.gov/funding/recidivism-forecasting-challenge

- The challenge aims to increase public safety and improve the fair administration of justice across the United States. 

- This challenge had three stages of prediction, and all three stages require modeling a binary outcome (recidivated vs. not recidivated in Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3). 

- In this class, we will only work on the second stage and try to develop a model for predicting the probability of an individual’s recidivism in the second year after initial release.

---

- There are 25,835 observations in the dataset.

  - 18,028 observations in the training dataset
  
  - 7,807 observations in the test dataset 

- 54 variables including 

  - a unique ID variable,
  
  - four outcome variables (Recidivism in Year 1, Recidivism in Year 2, and Recidivism in Year 3, Recidivism within three years),
  
  - a filter variable to indicate whether an observation is in the training dataset or test dataset,
  
  - the remaining 48 variables as potential predictive features. 
  
  A complete list of these variables can be found at     
  
  https://nij.ojp.gov/funding/recidivism-forecasting-challenge#recidivism-forecasting-challenge-database-fields-defined

---
  
## Installing Reticulate, Miniconda, and Sentence Transformers

- We will need to install the reticulate package and sentence_transformers module 
for the following weeks. 

  - The `reticulate` package provides an R interface to access Python modules and run any Python code without leaving the comfort of RStudio.
  
  - `sentence_transformers` is a Python module to access and utilize state-of-the-art pretrained language models
  
- You can run the following code in your computer to get prepared for the following weeks. Note that you only have to run the following code once to install the necessary packages.

.indent[
.tiny2[

```r
# Install the reticulate package

install.packages(pkgs = 'reticulate',
                 dependencies = TRUE)



# Install Miniconda

install_miniconda()
```
]
]

---

## Kaggle notebooks

- If you are having troubles about installing these packages in your computer, I highly recommend using a Kaggle R notebook which these packages are already installed.

- Please create a Kaggle notebook if you don't have one.
