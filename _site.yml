description: |

  This course focuses on applied machine learning (ML), with an emphasis on 
  supervised learning methods that have emerged over the last several decades.
  
  The primary goal of these methods is to create models capable of making
  accurate predictions, which generally implies less emphasis on statistical 
  inference.
