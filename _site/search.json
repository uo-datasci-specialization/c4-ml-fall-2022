The first dataset has a continuous outcome and the second dataset has a binary outcome. We will apply several methods and algorithms to these two datasets during the course. We will have an opportunity to compare and contrast the prediction outcomes from several models and methods on the same datasets.\r\nThis section provides some background information and context for these two datasets.\r\nReadability\r\nThe readability dataset comes from a recent Kaggle Competition (CommonLit Readability Prize). You can directly download the training dataset from the competition website, or you can import it from the course website.\r\n\r\n\r\nreadability <- read.csv(here('data/readability.csv'),header=TRUE)\r\n\r\nstr(readability)\r\n\r\n\r\n'data.frame':   2834 obs. of  6 variables:\r\n $ id            : chr  \"c12129c31\" \"85aa80a4c\" \"b69ac6792\" \"dd1000b26\" ...\r\n $ url_legal     : chr  \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" ...\r\n $ license       : chr  \"\" \"\" \"\" \"\" ...\r\n $ excerpt       : chr  \"When the young people returned to the ballroom, it presented a decidedly changed appearance.

Each observation represents a reading passage. The most significant variables are the excerpt and target columns. The excerpt column includes plain text data, and the target column includes a corresponding measure of readability for each excerpt.\r\n\r\n\r\nreadability[1,]$excerpt\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"When the young people returned to the ballroom, it presented a decidedly changed appearance. Instead of an interior scene, it was a winter landscape.\\nThe floor was covered with snow-white canvas, not laid on smoothly, but rumpled over bumps and hillocks, like a real snow field. The numerous palms and evergreens that had decorated the room, were powdered with flour and strewn with tufts of cotton, like snow. Also diamond dust had been lightly sprinkled on them, and glittering crystal icicles hung from the branches.\\nAt each end of the room, on the wall, hung a beautiful bear-skin rug.\\nThese rugs were for prizes, one for the girls and one for the boys. And this was the game.\\nThe girls were gathered at one end of the room and the boys at the other, and one end was called the North Pole, and the other the South Pole. Each player was given a small flag which they were to plant on reaching the Pole.\\nThis would have been an easy matter, but each traveller was obliged to wear snowshoes.\"\r\n\r\nreadability[1,]$target\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] -0.3402591\r\n\r\nAccording to the data owner, ‘the target value is the result of a Bradley-Terry analysis of more than 111,000 pairwise comparisons between excerpts. Teachers spanning grades 3-12 served as the raters for these comparisons.’ A lower target value indicates a more challenging text to read. The highest target score is equivalent to the 3rd-grade level, while the lowest target score is equivalent to the 12th-grade level. The purpose is to develop a model that predicts a readability score for a given text to identify an appropriate reading level.\r\nIn the following weeks, we will talk a little bit about the pre-trained language models (e.g., RoBerta). Our coverage of this material will be at the surface level. We will primarily cover how we obtain numerical vector representations (sentence embeddings) for given text input from a pre-trained language model using Python through R. Then, we will use the sentence embeddings as features to predict the target score in this dataset using various modeling frameworks.\r\nRecidivism\r\nThe Recidivism dataset comes from The National Institute of Justice’s (NIJ) Recidivism Forecasting Challenge. The challenge aims to increase public safety and improve the fair administration of justice across the United States. This challenge had three stages of prediction, and all three stages require modeling a binary outcome (recidivated vs. not recidivated in Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3). In this class, we will only work on the second stage and develop a model for predicting the probability of an individual’s recidivism in the second year after initial release.\r\nYou can download the training dataset directly from the competition website, or from the course website. Either way, please read the Terms of Use at this link before working with this dataset.\r\n\r\n\r\nrecidivism <-

unique ID variable, four outcome variables (Recidivism in Year 1, Recidivism in Year 2, and Recidivism in Year 3, Recidivism within three years), and a filter variable to indicate whether an observation was included in the training dataset or test dataset. The remaining 48 variables are potential predictive features. A complete list of these variables can be found at this link.\r\nWe will work on developing a model to predict the outcome variable Recidivism_Arrest_Year2 using the 48 potential predictive variables. Before moving forward, we must remove the individuals who had already recidivated in Year 1. As you can see below, about 29.9% of the individuals recidivated in Year 1. I am removing these individuals from the dataset.\r\n\r\n\r\ntable(recidivism$Recidivism_Arrest_Year1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE  TRUE \r\n18111  7724 \r\n\r\nrecidivism2 <- recidivism[recidivism$Recidivism_Arrest_Year1 == FALSE,]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI will also recode some variables before saving the new dataset for later use in class.\r\nFirst, some variables in the dataset are coded as TRUE and FALSE. When these variables are imported into R, R automatically recognizes them as logical variables. I will recode all these variables such that FALSE = 0 and TRUE = 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Find the columns recognized as logical\r\n\r\n  cols <- sapply(recidivism, is.logical)\r\n\r\n# Convert them to numeric 0s and 1s\r\n\r\n  recidivism2[,cols] <- lapply(recidivism2[,cols], as.numeric)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond, the highest value for some variables are coded as 3 or more, 4 or more, 10 or more, etc. These variables can be considered as numeric, but R recognizes them as character vectors due to phrase or more for the highest value. We will recode these variables so ‘X or more’ will be equal to X.\r\n\r\n\r\nrequire(dplyr)\r\n\r\n# Dependents\r\n\r\n  recidivism2$Dependents <- recode(recidivism2$Dependents,\r\n

weeks, we will work with this version of the dataset.\r\nInstalling Reticulate, Miniconda, and Sentence Transformers\r\nYou will need to install the reticulate package and sentence_transformers module for the following weeks. You can run the following code in your computer to get prepared for the following weeks. Note that you only have to run the following code once to install the necessary packages.\r\nIf you are having troubles about installing these packages in your computer, I highly recommend using a Kaggle R notebook which these packages are already installed (I will give more information about this in class).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Install the reticulate package\r\n\r\ninstall.packages(pkgs = 'reticulate',\r\n                 dependencies = TRUE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Install Miniconda\r\n\r\ninstall_miniconda()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce you install the reticulate package, run the following code to get python configurations and make sure everything is properly installed.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Load the reticulate package\r\n\r\nrequire(reticulate)\r\n\r\nconda_list()\r\n\r\n\r\n          name\r\n1    Anaconda3\r\n2 r-reticulate\r\n                                                                          python\r\n1                                       C:\\\\Users\\\\cengiz\\\\Anaconda3\\\\python.exe\r\n2 C:\\\\Users\\\\cengiz\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\r-miniconda\\\\envs\\\\r-reticulate\\\\python.exe\r\n\r\nYou should see r-reticulate under the name column as one of your virtual Python environment. Finally, you will also need to install the sentence transformers module. The following code will install the sentence transformers module to the virtual Python environment r-reticulate.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Install the sentence transformer module \r\n\r\nuse_condaenv('r-reticulate')\r\n\r\nconda_install(envname  = 'r-reticulate',\r\n              packages = 'sentence_transformers',\r\n              pip      = TRUE)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"sentence_transformers\"\r\n\r\n  # try pip=FALSE, if it gives an error message\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce you install the Python packages using the code above, you can run the following code. If you are seeing the same output as below, you should be all set to explore some very exciting NLP tools using the Readability dataset.\r\n\r\n\r\nrequire(reticulate)\r\n\r\n# Import the sentence transformer module\r\n\r\nreticulate::import('sentence_transformers')\r\n\r\n\r\nModule(sentence_transformers)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\r\nSection 1 – Definitions.\r\nAdapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\r\nAdapter’s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\nCopyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized.

Your has a corresponding meaning.\r\nSection 2 – Scope.\r\nLicense grant.\r\nSubject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\r\nreproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\r\nproduce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\r\n\r\nExceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\r\nTerm. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\r\nMedia and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\r\nnever produces Adapted Material.\r\n\r\nDownstream recipients.\r\nOffer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\nNo downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\r\n\r\nNo endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\r\n\r\nOther rights.\r\nMoral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\r\nPatent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\r\nTo the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\r\n\r\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\r\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\r\nAttribution.\r\nIf You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\r\nretain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\r\nidentification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\r\na copyright notice;\r\na notice that refers to this Public License;\r\na notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\r\na URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\r\n\r\nindicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\r\nindicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\r\n\r\nYou may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\r\nIf requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\r\nIf You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter’s License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\r\n\r\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\r\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\r\nfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\r\nif You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\r\nYou must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\r\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\r\nUNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\nTO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\r\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\r\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\r\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\r\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\r\nautomatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\r\nupon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\r\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\r\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\r\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\r\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\r\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\r\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\r\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\r\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\r\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\r\n=======================================================================\r\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.
